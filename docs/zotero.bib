Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

As a consequence, a number of questions need to be answered in order to ensure proper benchmarking, resource measurement, and presentation of results, all of which is essential for researchers, tool developers, and users, as well as for tool competitions. We identify a set of requirements that are indispensable for reliable benchmarking and resource measurement of time and memory usage of automatic solvers, verifiers, and similar tools, and discuss limitations of existing methods and benchmarking tools. Fulfilling these requirements in a benchmarking framework can (on Linux systems) currently only be done by using the cgroup and namespace features of the kernel. We developed BenchExec, a ready-to-use, tool-independent, and open-source implementation of a benchmarking framework that fulfills all presented requirements, making reliable benchmarking and resource measurement easy. Our framework is able to work with a wide range of different tools, has proven its reliability and usefulness in the International Competition on Software Verification, and is used by several research groups worldwide to ensure reliable benchmarking. Finally, we present guidelines on how to present measurement results in a scientifically valid and comprehensible way.},

Focusing on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model as a case study, data preparation steps are sequenced using rules within iRODS. VIC and iRODS are applied to study hydrologic conditions in the Carolinas, USA during the period 1998{\textendash}2007 to better understand impacts of drought within the region.

Although the formal modelling of scientific workflow provenance was of interest and studied, in many fields like semantic web, yet no provenance model has existed, we are aware of, to model control-flow driven scientific workflows. The provenance models proposed by the semantic web community for data-driven scientific workflows may capture the provenance of control-flow driven workflows execution traces (i.e., retrospective provenance) but underspecify the workflow structure (i.e., workflow provenance). An underspecified or incomplete structure of a workflow results in the misinterpretation of a scientific experiment and precludes conformance checking of the workflow, thereby restricting the gains of provenance. To overcome the limitation, we present a formal, lightweight and general-purpose specification model for the control-flows involved scientific workflows. The proposed model can be combined with the existing provenance models and easy to extend to specify the common control-flow patterns. In this article, we inspire the need for control-flow driven scientific workflow provenance model, provide an overview of its key classes and properties, and briefly discuss its integration with the ProvONE provenance model as well as its compatibility to PROV-DM. We will also focus on the sample modelling using the proposed model and present a comprehensive implementation scenario from the agricultural domain for validating the model.},

Secondary studies, one of the main EBSE products, are intended to summarize the ``best'' research evidence and make them easily consumable by practitioners. However, recent studies show that some secondary studies lack connections with software engineering practice. In this chapter, we present the concept of Rapid Reviews, which are lightweight secondary studies focused on delivering evidence to practitioners in a timely manner. Rapid reviews support practitioners in their decision-making, and should be conducted bounded to a practical problem, inserted into a practical context. Thus, Rapid Reviews can be easily integrated in a knowledge/technology transfer initiative. After describing the basic concepts, we present the results and experiences of conducting two Rapid Reviews. We also provide guidelines to help researchers and practitioners who want to conduct Rapid Reviews, and we finally discuss topics that may concern the research community about the feasibility of Rapid Reviews as an evidence-based method. In conclusion, we believe Rapid Reviews might be of interest to researchers and practitioners working on the intersection of software engineering research and practice.},

They are adaptations of regular systematic reviews made to fit practitioners constraints. Goal: Evaluate the perceptions from SE practitioners on the use of Rapid Reviews to support decision-making in SE practice. Method: We conducted an Action Research to evaluate RRs insertion in a real-world software development project. Results: Our results show that practitioners are rater positive about Rapid Reviews. They reported to have learned new concepts, reduced time and cost of decision-making, improved their understanding about the problem their facing, among other benefits. Additionally, two months after the introduction of the Rapid Review, in a follow up visit, we perceived that the practitioners have indeed adopted the evidence provided. Conclusions: Based on the positive results we obtained with this study, and the experiences reported in medicine, we believe RRs could play an important role towards knowledge transfer and decision-making support in SE practice.},

  abstract = {Randomized sampling has recently been proven a highly efficient technique for computing approximate factorizations of matrices that have low numerical rank. This paper describes an extension of such techniques to a wider class of matrices that are not themselves rank-deficient but have off-diagonal blocks that are; specifically, the class of so-called hierarchically semiseparable (HSS) matrices. HSS matrices arise frequently in numerical analysis and signal processing, particularly in the construction of fast methods for solving differential and integral equations numerically. The HSS structure admits algebraic operations (matrix-vector multiplications, matrix factorizations, matrix inversion, etc.) to be performed very rapidly, but only once the HSS representation of the matrix has been constructed. How to rapidly compute this representation in the first place is much less well understood. The present paper demonstrates that if an \$N{\textbackslash}times N\$ matrix can be applied to a vector in \$O(N)\$ time, and if individual entries of the matrix can be computed rapidly, then provided that an HSS representation of the matrix exists, it can be constructed in \$O(N{\textbackslash},k\^\{2\})\$ operations, where k is an upper bound for the numerical rank of the off-diagonal blocks. The point is that when legacy codes (based on, e.g., the fast multipole method) can be used for the fast matrix-vector multiply, the proposed algorithm can be used to obtain the HSS representation of the matrix, and then well-established techniques for HSS matrices can be used to invert or factor the matrix.},

  abstract = {The goal of this research is to develop and test a theoretical model of the effect of system characteristics on user acceptance of computer-based information systems. The model, referred to as the technology acceptance model (TAM), is being developed with two major objectives in mind. First, it should improve our understanding of user acceptance processes, providing new theoretical insights into the successful design and implementation of information systems. Second, TAM should provide the theoretical basis for a practical "user acceptance testing" methodology that would enable system designers and implementors to evaluate proposed new systems prior to their implementation. Applying the proposed model in user acceptance testing would involve demonstrating system prototypes to potential users and measuring their motivation to use the alternative systems. Such user acceptance testing could provide useful information about the relative likelihood of success of proposed systems early in their development, where such information has greatest value. Based on these objectives, key questions guiding this research include: 1. What are the major motivational variables that mediate between system characteristics and actual use of computer-based systems by end-users in organiza ional settings? 2. How are these variables causally related to one another, to system characteristics, and to user behavior? 3. How can user motivation be measured prior to organizational implementation in order to evaluate the rebtive likelihood of user acceptance for proposed new systems? For user acceptance testing to be viable, the associated model of user motivation must be valid. The present research takes several steps toward establishing a valid motivational model of the user, and aims to provide the foundation for future research that will tend to lead toward this end. Research steps taken in the present thesis include: 1. a fairly general, well-established theoretical model of human behavior from psychology was chosen as a paradigm within which to formulate the proposed technology acceptance model; 2. several adaptations to this paradigm were introduced in order to render it applicable to the present context; 3. published literature in the Management Information Systems and Human Factors fields was reviewed to demonstrate that empirical support exists for various elements of the proposed model, while at the same time the model goes beyond existing theoretical specifications, building upon and integrating previous research in a cumulative manner; 4. measures for the model's psychological variables were developed and pre-tested; 5. a field survey of 100 organizational users was conducted in order to validate the measures of the model's variables, and to test the model's structure, and 6. a laboratory user acceptance experiment of two business graphics systems involving 40 MBA student subjects was performed to further test the proposed model's structure, to test the ability to substitute videotape presentation for hands-on interaction in user acceptance tests, to evaluate the specific graphics systems being tested, and to test several theoretical extensions and refinements to the propose},

  author = {Dolstra, Eelco},
  year = {2006},
  month = jan,
  urldate = {2023-08-24},
  abstract = {Software deployment is the set of activities related to getting software components to work on the machines of end users. It includes activities such as installation, upgrading, uninstallation, and so on. Many tools have been developed to support deployment, but they all have serious limitations with respect to correctness. For instance, the installation of a component can lead to the failure of previously installed components; a component might require other components that are not present; and it is generally difficult to undo deployment actions. The fundamental causes of these problems are a lack of isolation between components, the difficulty in identifying the dependencies between components, and incompatibilities between versions and variants of components. This thesis describes a better approach based on a purely functional deployment model, implemented in a deployment system called Nix. Components are stored in isolation from each other in a Nix store. Each component has a name that contains a cryptographic hash of all inputs that contributed to its build process, and the content of a component never changes after it has been built. Hence the model is purely functional. This storage scheme provides several important advantages. First, it ensures isolation between components: if two components differ in any way, they will be stored in different locations and will not overwrite each other. Second, it allows us to identify component dependencies. Undeclared build time dependencies are prevented due to the absence of "global" component directories used in other deployment systems. Runtime dependencies can be found by scanning for cryptographic hashes in the binary contents of components, a technique analogous to conservative garbage collection in programming language implementation. Since dependency information is complete, complete deployment can be performed by copying closures of components under the dependency relation. Developers and users are not confronted with components' cryptographic hashes directly. Components are built automatically from Nix expressions, which describe how to build and compose arbitrary software components; hashes are computed as part of this process. Components are automatically made available to users through "user environments", which are synthesised sets of activated components. User environments enable atomic upgrades and rollbacks, as well as different sets of activated components for different users. Nix expressions provide a source-based deployment model. However, source-based deployment can be transparently optimised into binary deployment by making pre-built binaries (keyed on their cryptographic hashes) available in a shared location such as a network server. This is referred to as transparent source/binary deployment. The purely functional deployment model has been validated by applying it to the deployment of more than 278 existing Unix packages. In addition, this thesis shows that the model can be applied naturally to the related activities of continuous integration using build farms, service deployment and build management.},

  abstract = {Regression test selection (RTS) and prioritization (RTP) techniques aim to reduce testing efforts and developer feedback time after a change to the code base. Using various information sources, including test traces, build dependencies, version control data, and test histories, they have been shown to be effective. However, not all of these sources are guaranteed to be available and accessible for arbitrary continuous integration (CI) environments. In contrast, metadata from version control systems (VCSs) and CI systems are readily available and inexpensive. Yet, corresponding RTP and RTS techniques are scattered across research and often only evaluated on synthetic faults or in a specific industrial context. It is cumbersome for practitioners to identify insights that apply to their context, let alone to calibrate associated parameters for maximum cost-effectiveness. This paper consolidates existing work on RTP and unsafe RTS into an actionable methodology to build and evaluate such approaches that exclusively rely on CI and VCS metadata. To investigate how these approaches from prior research compare in heterogeneous settings, we apply the methodology in a large-scale empirical study on a set of 23 projects covering 37,000 CI logs and 76,000 VCS commits. We find that these approaches significantly outperform established RTP baselines and, while still triggering 90\% of the failures, we show that practitioners can expect to save on average 84\% of test execution time for unsafe RTS. We also find that it can be beneficial to limit training data, features from test history work better than change-based features, and, somewhat surprisingly, simple and well-known heuristics often outperform complex machine-learned models.},

Existing mechanisms focus on tracking users' activities while they are connected to the database, and are unable to detect anomalous actions that the users perform on the data once they gain access to it. Being able to detect anomalous actions on the data is critical as these actions are often sign of attempts to misuse data. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect anomalous actions executed on data returned to the users from a database. The approach has been implemented as part of the Provenancebased ANomaly Detection of Data Exfiltration (PANDDE) tool. PANDDE leverages data provenance information captured at the operating system level. Such information is then used to create profiles of users' actions on the data once retrieved from the database. The profiles indicate actions that are consistent with the tasks of the users. Actions recorded in the profiles include data printing, emailing, and storage. Profiles are then used at run-time to detect anomalous actions.},

They are used to describe complex computational applications that require efficient and robust management of large volumes of data, which are typically stored/processed on heterogeneous, distributed resources. The workflow research and development community has employed a number of methods for the quantitative evaluation of existing and novel workflow algorithms and systems. In particular, a common approach is to simulate workflow executions. In previous work, we have presented a collection of tools that have been used for aiding research and development activities in the Pegasus project, and that have been adopted by others for conducting workflow research. Despite their popularity, there are several shortcomings that prevent easy adoption, maintenance, and consistency with the evolving structures and computational requirements of production workflows. In this work, we present WorkflowHub, a community framework that provides a collection of tools for analyzing workflow execution traces, producing realistic synthetic workflow traces, and simulating workflow executions. We demonstrate the realism of the generated synthetic traces by comparing simulated executions of these traces with actual workflow executions. We also contrast these results with those obtained when using the previously available collection of tools. We find that our framework not only can be used to generate representative synthetic workflow traces (i.e., with workflow structures and task characteristics distributions that resemble those in traces obtained from real-world workflow executions), but can also generate representative workflow traces at larger scales than that of available workflow traces.},

To explore this idea, we have developed the Chimera virtual data system, which combines a virtual data catalog for representing data derivation procedures and derived data, with a virtual data language interpreter that translates user requests into data definition and query operations on the database. We couple the Chimera system with distributed "data grid" services to enable on-demand execution of computation schedules constructed from database queries. We have applied this system to two challenge problems, the reconstruction of simulated collision event data from a high-energy physics experiment, and searching digital sky survey data for galactic clusters, with promising results.},

We argue that the workflows that are published in current approaches are dependent on the specific codes used for execution, the specific workflow system used, and the specific workflow catalogs where they are published. In this paper, we describe a new approach that addresses these shortcomings and makes workflows more reusable through: 1) the use of abstract workflows to complement executable workflows to make them reusable when the execution environment is different, 2) the publication of both abstract and executable workflows using standards such as the Open Provenance Model that can be imported by other workflow systems, 3) the publication of workflows as Linked Data that results in open web accessible workflow repositories. We illustrate this approach using a complex workflow that we re-created from an influential publication that describes the generation of 'drugomes'.},

The underlying data model used throughout the system is graph-based, consisting of vertices and directed edges that are modeled after the node and relationship types described in the Open Provenance Model. The system has been designed to decouple the collection, storage, and querying of provenance metadata. At its core is a novel provenance kernel that mediates between the producers and consumers of provenance information, and handles the persistent storage of records. It operates as a service, peering with remote instances to enable distributed provenance queries. The provenance kernel on each host handles the buffering, filtering, and multiplexing of incoming metadata from multiple sources, including the operating system, applications, and manual curation. Provenance elements can be located locally with queries that use wildcard, fuzzy, proximity, range, and Boolean operators. Ancestor and descendant queries are transparently propagated across hosts until a terminating expression is satisfied, while distributed path queries are accelerated with provenance sketches.},

We are witnessing a growing number of efforts that treat workflows as first-class artifacts for sharing and exchanging scientific knowledge, either as part of scholarly articles or as stand-alone objects. However, workflows are not born to be reliable, which can seriously damage their reusability and trustworthiness as knowledge exchange instruments. Scientific workflows are commonly subject to decay, which consequently undermines their reliability over their lifetime. The reliability of workflows can be notably improved by advocating scientists to preserve a minimal set of information that is essential to assist the interpretations of these workflows and hence improve their potential for reproducibility and reusability. In this paper we show how, by measuring and monitoring the completeness and stability of scientific workflows over time we are able to provide scientists with a measure of their reliability, supporting the reuse of trustworthy scientific knowledge.},

However, those disparate components also increase the probability that the computational experiment fails to be reproducible. Even if software is reproducible today, it may become irreproducible tomorrow without the software itself changing at all, because of the constantly changing software environment in which the software is run. To alleviate irreproducibility, workflow engines integrate with container engines. Additionally, communities that sprung up around workflow engines started to host registries for workflows that follow standards. These standards reduce the effort needed to make workflows automatically reproducible. In this paper, we study automatic reproduction of workflows from two registries, focusing on non-crashing executions. The experimental data lets us analyze the upper bound to which workflow engines could achieve reproducibility. We identify lessons learned in achieving reproducibility in practice.},

While the prevalence and importance of flakiness is well established, prior research focused on Java projects, thus raising the question of how the findings generalize. In order to provide a better understanding of the role of flakiness in software development beyond Java, we empirically study the prevalence, causes, and degree of flakiness within software written in Python, one of the currently most popular programming languages. For this, we sampled 22 352 open source projects from the popular PyPI package index, and analyzed their 876 186 test cases for flakiness. Our investigation suggests that flakiness is equally prevalent in Python as it is in Java. The reasons, however, are different: Order dependency is a much more dominant problem in Python, causing 59 \% of the 7 571 flaky tests in our dataset. Another 28 \% were caused by test infrastructure problems, which represent a previously undocumented cause of flakiness. The remaining 13 \% can mostly be attributed to the use of network and randomness APIs by the projects, which is indicative of the type of software commonly written in Python. Our data also suggests that finding flaky tests requires more runs than are often done in the literature: A 95 \% confidence that a passing test case is not flaky on average would require 170 reruns.},

Based on system-layer audit logs (e.g., syscalls), these approaches omit vital sources of application context (e.g., email addresses, HTTP response codes) that can found in higher layers of the system. Although this information is often essential to understanding attack behaviors, incorporating this evidence into causal analysis engines is difficult due to the semantic gap that exists between system layers. To address this shortcoming, we propose the notion of universal provenance, which encodes all forensically-relevant causal dependencies regardless of their layer of origin. To transparently realize this vision on commodity systems, we present {$\omega$}LOG (``Omega Log''), a provenance tracking mechanism that bridges the semantic gap between system and application logging contexts. {$\omega$}LOG analyzes program binaries to identify and model application-layer logging behaviors, enabling application events to be accurately reconciled with system-layer accesses. {$\omega$}LOG then intercepts applications' runtime logging activities and grafts those events onto the system-layer provenance graph, allowing investigators to reason more precisely about the nature of attacks. We demonstrate that {$\omega$}LOG is widely-applicable to existing software projects and can transparently facilitate execution partitioning of dependency graphs without any training or developer intervention. Evaluation on real-world attack scenarios shows that universal provenance graphs are concise and rich with semantic information as compared to the state-of-the-art, with 12\% average runtime overhead.},

The true dependencies between security-sensitive files, network endpoints, or memory objects from different hosts can be easily concealed by dependency explosion or undefined program behavior (e.g., memory corruption). Dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT) is a potential solution to this problem, but, existing DIFT techniques only track information flow within a single host and lack an efficient mechanism to maintain and synchronize the data flow tags globally across multiple hosts.  In this paper, we propose RTAG, an efficient data flow tagging and tracking mechanism that enables practical cross-host attack investigations. RTAG is based on three novel techniques. First, by using a record-and-replay technique, it decouples the dependencies between different data flow tags from the analysis, enabling lazy synchronization between independent and parallel DIFT instances of different hosts. Second, it takes advantage of systemcall-level provenance information to calculate and allocate the optimal tag map in terms of memory consumption. Third, it embeds tag information into network packets to track cross-host data flows with less than 0.05\% network bandwidth overhead. Evaluation results show that RTAG is able to recover the true data flows of realistic cross-host attack scenarios. Performance wise, RTAG reduces the memory consumption of DIFT-based analysis by up to 90\% and decreases the overall analysis time by 60\%{\textendash}90\% compared with previous investigation systems.},

  abstract = {As modern attacks become more stealthy and persistent, detecting or preventing them at their early stages becomes virtually impossible. Instead, an attack investigation or provenance system aims to continuously monitor and log interesting system events with minimal overhead. Later, if the system observes any anomalous behavior, it analyzes the log to identify who initiated the attack and which resources were affected by the attack and then assess and recover from any damage incurred. However, because of a fundamental tradeoff between log granularity and system performance, existing systems typically record system-call events without detailed program-level activities (e.g., memory operation) required for accurately reconstructing attack causality or demand that every monitored program be instrumented to provide program-level information. To address this issue, we propose RAIN, a Refinable Attack INvestigation system based on a record-replay technology that records system-call events during runtime and performs instruction-level dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT) during on-demand process replay. Instead of replaying every process with DIFT, RAIN conducts system-call-level reachability analysis to filter out unrelated processes and to minimize the number of processes to be replayed, making inter-process DIFT feasible. Evaluation results show that RAIN effectively prunes out unrelated processes and determines attack causality with negligible false positive rates. In addition, the runtime overhead of RAIN is similar to existing system-call level provenance systems and its analysis overhead is much smaller than full-system DIFT.},

In order to detect the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), online execution needs to be recorded with acceptable runtime overhead; then, investigators can analyze the replayed execution with heavy dynamic instrumentation. While most record and replay systems rely on kernel module or OS virtualization, those running at user space are favoured for being lighter weight and more portable without any of the changes needed for OS/Kernel virtualization. On the other hand, higher level provenance data at a higher level provides dynamic analysis with system causalities and hugely increases its efficiency. Considering both benefits, we propose a provenance-aware user space record and replay system, called RecProv. RecProv is designed to provide high provenance fidelity; specifically, with versioning files from the recorded trace logs and integrity protection to provenance data through real-time trace isolation. The collected provenance provides the high-level system dependency that helps pinpoint suspicious activities where further analysis can be applied. We show that RecProv is able to output accurate provenance in both visualized graph and W3C standardized PROV-JSON formats.},

  abstract = {Measuring performance \& quantifying a performance change are core evaluation techniques in programming language and systems research. Of 122 recent scientific papers, as many as 65 included experimental evaluation that quantified a performance change using a ratio of execution times. Few of these papers evaluated their results with the level of rigour that has come to be expected in other experimental sciences. The uncertainty of measured results was largely ignored. Scarcely any of the papers mentioned uncertainty in the ratio of the mean execution times, and most did not even mention uncertainty in the two means themselves. Most of the papers failed to address the non-deterministic execution of computer programs (caused by factors such as memory placement, for example), and none addressed non-deterministic compilation. It turns out that the statistical methods presented in the computer systems performance evaluation literature for the design and summary of experiments do not readily allow this either. This poses a hazard to the repeatability, reproducibility and even validity of quantitative results. Inspired by statistical methods used in other fields of science, and building on results in statistics that did not make it to introductory textbooks, we present a statistical model that allows us both to quantify uncertainty in the ratio of (execution time) means and to design experiments with a rigorous treatment of those multiple sources of non-determinism that might impact measured performance. Better still, under our framework summaries can be as simple as "system A is faster than system B by 5.5\% \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 2.5\%, with 95\% confidence", a more natural statement than those derived from typical current practice, which are often misinterpreted.

DFT has been repeatedly implemented by a variety of tools for numerous purposes, including protection from zero-day and cross-site scripting attacks, detection and prevention of information leaks, and for the analysis of legitimate and malicious software. We present libdft, a dynamic DFT framework that unlike previous work is at once fast, reusable, and works with commodity software and hardware. libdft provides an API for building DFT-enabled tools that work on unmodified binaries, running on common operating systems and hardware, thus facilitating research and rapid prototyping. We explore different approaches for implementing the low-level aspects of instruction-level data tracking, introduce a more efficient and 64-bit capable shadow memory, and identify (and avoid) the common pitfalls responsible for the excessive performance overhead of previous studies. We evaluate libdft using real applications with large codebases like the Apache and MySQL servers, and the Firefox web browser. We also use a series of benchmarks and utilities to compare libdft with similar systems. Our results indicate that it performs at least as fast, if not faster, than previous solutions, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate the performance overhead of a fast dynamic DFT implementation in such depth. Finally, libdft is freely available as open source software.},

It determines whether an event e is causally dependent on a preceding event c during execution. We develop a new causality inference engine LDX. Given an execution, it spawns a slave execution, in which it mutates c and observes whether any change is induced at e. To preclude non-determinism, LDX couples the executions by sharing syscall outcomes. To handle path differences induced by the perturbation, we develop a novel on-the-fly execution alignment scheme that maintains a counter to reflect the progress of execution. The scheme relies on program analysis and compiler transformation. LDX can effectively detect information leak and security attacks with an average overhead of 6.08\% while running the master and the slave concurrently on separate CPUs, much lower than existing systems that require instruction level monitoring. Furthermore, it has much better accuracy in causality inference.},

It leverages a recent dynamic analysis, dual execution (LDX), that can infer precise causality between system calls but unfortunately requires doubling the resource consumption such as CPU time and memory consumption. For each application, we use LDX to acquire precise causal models for a set of primitive operations. Each model is a sequence of system calls that have inter-dependences, some of them caused by memory operations and hence implicit at the system call level. These models are described by a language that supports various complexity such as regular, context-free, and even context-sensitive. In production run, a novel parser is deployed to parse audit logs (without any enhancement) to model instances and hence derive causality. Our evaluation on a set of real-world programs shows that the technique is highly effective. The generated models can recover causality with 0\% false-positives (FP) and false-negatives (FN) for most programs and only 8.3\% FP and 5.2\% FN in the worst cases. The models also feature excellent composibility, meaning that the models derived from primitive operations can be composed together to describe causality for large and complex real world missions. Applying our technique to attack investigation shows that the system-wide attack causal graphs are highly precise and concise, having better quality than the state-of-the-art.},

LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.},

Traditionally, this is done by analyzing audit log. However, the presence of long running programs makes a live process receiving a large volume of inputs and produce many outputs and each output may be causally related to all the preceding inputs, leading to dependence explosion and making attack investigations almost infeasible. We observe that a long running execution can be partitioned into individual units by monitoring the execution of the program's event-handling loops, with each iteration corresponding to the processing of an independent input/request. We reverse engineer such loops from application binaries. We also reverse engineer instructions that could cause workflows between units. Detecting such a workflow is critical to disclosing causality between units. We then perform selective logging for unit boundaries and unit dependences. Our experiments show that our technique, called BEEP, has negligible runtime overhead ({$<$} 1.4\%) and low space overhead (12.28\% on average). It is effective in capturing the minimal causal graph for every attack case we have studied, without any dependence explosion.},

They are highly valuable for forensic analysis that aims to identify the root cause of an attack, which may occur long ago, or to determine the ramifications of an attack for recovery from it. A key challenge of audit log-based forensics in practice is the sheer size of the log files generated, which could grow at a rate of Gigabytes per day. In this paper, we propose LogGC, an audit logging system with garbage collection (GC) capability. We identify and overcome the unique challenges of garbage collection in the context of computer forensic analysis, which makes LogGC different from traditional memory GC techniques. We also develop techniques that instrument user applications at a small number of selected places to emit additional system events so that we can substantially reduce the false dependences between system events to improve GC effectiveness. Our results show that LogGC can reduce audit log size by 14 times for regular user systems and 37 times for server systems, without affecting the accuracy of forensic analysis.},

In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic concepts about system-level provenance graph and present a typical system architecture for provenance graph-based threat detection and investigation. A comprehensive provenance graph-based threat detection system can be divided into three modules: data collection module, data management module, and threat detection modules. Each module contains several components and involves different research problems. We systematically taxonomize and compare the existing algorithms and designs involved in them. Based on these comparisons, we identify the strategy of technology selection for real-world deployment.

  abstract = {Robust and powerful software instrumentation tools are essential for program analysis tasks such as profiling, performance evaluation, and bug detection. To meet this need, we have developed a new instrumentation system called Pin. Our goals are to provide easy-to-use, portable, transparent, and efficient instrumentation. Instrumentation tools (called Pintools) are written in C/C++ using Pin's rich API. Pin follows the model of ATOM, allowing the tool writer to analyze an application at the instruction level without the need for detailed knowledge of the underlying instruction set. The API is designed to be architecture independent whenever possible, making Pintools source compatible across different architectures. However, a Pintool can access architecture-specific details when necessary. Instrumentation with Pin is mostly transparent as the application and Pintool observe the application's original, uninstrumented behavior. Pin uses dynamic compilation to instrument executables while they are running. For efficiency, Pin uses several techniques, including inlining, register re-allocation, liveness analysis, and instruction scheduling to optimize instrumentation. This fully automated approach delivers significantly better instrumentation performance than similar tools. For example, Pin is 3.3x faster than Valgrind and 2x faster than DynamoRIO for basic-block counting. To illustrate Pin's versatility, we describe two Pintools in daily use to analyze production software. Pin is publicly available for Linux platforms on four architectures: IA32 (32-bit x86), EM64T (64-bit x86), Itanium{\textregistered}, and ARM. In the ten months since Pin 2 was released in July 2004, there have been over 3000 downloads from its website.},

By analyzing ETW log and critical parts of application executables, a model can be constructed to parse ETW log to units representing independent sub-executions in a process. Causality inferred at the unit level renders much higher accuracy, allowing us to perform accurate attack investigation and highly effective log reduction.},

Existing techniques either suffer from the dependence explosion problem or have non-trivial space and runtime overhead, which hinder their application in practice. We propose ProTracer, a lightweight provenance tracing system that alternates between system event logging and unit level taint propagation. The technique is built on an on-the-fly system event processing infrastructure that features a very lightweight kernel module and a sophisticated user space daemon that performs concurrent and out-of-order event processing. The evaluation with different realistic system workloads and a number of attack cases show that ProTracer only produces 13MB log data per day, and 0.84GB(Server)/2.32GB(Client) in 3 months without losing any important information. The space consumption is only {$<$} 1.28\% of the state-of-the-art, 7 times smaller than an off-line garbage collection technique. The run-time overhead averages {$<$}7\% for servers and {$<$}5\% for regular applications. The generated attack causal graphs are a few times smaller than those by existing techniques while they are equally informative.},

Most existing provenance systems, however, operate at only one level of abstraction: the system call layer, a workflow specification, or the high-level constructs of a particular application. The provenance collectable in each of these layers is different, and all of it can be important. Single-layer systems fail to account for the different levels of abstraction at which users need to reason about their data and processes. These systems cannot integrate data provenance across layers and cannot answer questions that require an integrated view of the provenance. We have designed a provenance collection structure facilitating the integration of provenance across multiple levels of abstraction, including a workflow engine, a web browser, and an initial runtime Python provenance tracking wrapper. We layer these components atop provenance-aware network storage (NFS) that builds upon a Provenance-Aware Storage System (PASS). We discuss the challenges of building systems that integrate provenance across multiple layers of abstraction, present how we augmented systems in each layer to integrate provenance, and present use cases that demonstrate how provenance spanning multiple layers provides functionality not available in existing systems. Our evaluation shows that the overheads imposed by layering provenance systems are reasonable.},

Existing record-and-replay approaches limit deployability by recording an entire virtual machine (heavyweight), modifying the OS kernel (adding deployment and maintenance costs), requiring pervasive code instrumentation (imposing significant performance and complexity overhead), or modifying compilers and runtime systems (limiting generality). We investigated whether it is possible to build a practical record-and-replay system avoiding all these issues. The answer turns out to be yes - if the CPU and operating system meet certain non-obvious constraints. Fortunately modern Intel CPUs, Linux kernels and user-space frameworks do meet these constraints, although this has only become true recently. With some novel optimizations, our system 'rr' records and replays real-world low-parallelism workloads with low overhead, with an entirely user-space implementation, using stock hardware, compilers, runtimes and operating systems. "rr" forms the basis of an open-source reverse-execution debugger seeing significant use in practice. We present the design and implementation of 'rr', describe its performance on a variety of workloads, and identify constraints on hardware and operating system design required to support our approach.},

With the advent of computational experiments (modeled as scientific workflows) and Scientific Workflow Management Systems, produced and consumed data, as well as the provenance of a given experiment, are automatically managed, so provenance capturing and storing in such a context is no longer a major concern. Similarly to several existing big data problems, the bottom line is now on how to analyze the large amounts of provenance data generated by workflow executions and how to be able to extract useful knowledge of this data. In this context, this article surveys the current state of the art on provenance analytics by presenting the key initiatives that have been taken to support provenance data analysis. We also contribute by proposing a taxonomy to classify elements related to provenance analytics.},

Data provenance has many uses, from forensics and security to aiding the reproducibility of scientific experiments. We present CamFlow, a whole-system provenance capture mechanism that integrates easily into a PaaS offering. While there have been several prior whole-system provenance systems that captured a comprehensive, systemic and ubiquitous record of a system's behavior, none have been widely adopted. They either A) impose too much overhead, B) are designed for long-outdated kernel releases and are hard to port to current systems, C) generate too much data, or D) are designed for a single system. CamFlow addresses these shortcoming by: 1) leveraging the latest kernel design advances to achieve efficiency; 2) using a self-contained, easily maintainable implementation relying on a Linux Security Module, NetFilter, and other existing kernel facilities; 3) providing a mechanism to tailor the captured provenance data to the needs of the application; and 4) making it easy to integrate provenance across distributed systems. The provenance we capture is streamed and consumed by tenant-built auditor applications. We illustrate the usability of our implementation by describing three such applications: demonstrating compliance with data regulations; performing fault/intrusion detection; and implementing data loss prevention. We also show how CamFlow can be leveraged to capture meaningful provenance without modifying existing applications.},

Scripting languages are easy to learn and use, and they allow complex tasks to be specified and executed in fewer steps than with traditional programming languages. However, they also have important limitations for reproducibility and data management. As experiments are iteratively refined, it is challenging to reason about each experiment run (or trial), to keep track of the association between trials and experiment instances as well as the differences across trials, and to connect results to specific input data and parameters. Approaches have been proposed that address these limitations by collecting, managing, and analyzing the provenance of scripts. In this article, we survey the state of the art in provenance for scripts. We have identified the approaches by following an exhaustive protocol of forward and backward literature snowballing. Based on a detailed study, we propose a taxonomy and classify the approaches using this taxonomy.},

  abstract = {Data science has become prevalent in a large variety of domains. Inherent in its practice is an exploratory, probing, and fact finding journey, which consists of the assembly, adaptation, and execution of complex data science pipelines. The trustworthiness of the results of such pipelines rests entirely on their ability to be reproduced with fidelity, which is difficult if pipelines are not documented or recorded minutely and consistently. This difficulty has led to a reproducibility crisis and presents a major obstacle to the safe adoption of the pipeline results in production environments. The crisis can be resolved if the provenance for each data science pipeline is captured transparently as pipelines are executed. However, due to the complexity of modern data science pipelines, transparently capturing sufficient provenance to allow for reproducibility is challenging. As a result, most existing systems require users to augment their code or use specific tools to capture provenance, which hinders productivity and results in a lack of adoption. In this paper, we present Ursprung,1 a transparent provenance collection system designed for data science environments.2 The Ursprung philosophy is to capture provenance and build lineage by integrating with the execution environment to automatically track static and runtime configuration parameters of data science pipelines. Rather than requiring data scientists to make changes to their code, Ursprung records basic provenance information from system-level sources and combines it with provenance from application-level sources (e.g., log files, stdout), which can be accessed and recorded through a domain-specific language. In our evaluation, we show that Ursprung is able to capture sufficient provenance for a variety of use cases and only adds an overhead of up to 4\%.},

However, their usefulness is compromised if they do not work correctly on a system under evaluation or, in general, if they cannot be used consistently to compare different systems. A well-known benchmark suite of parallel applications is the Splash-2 suite. Since its creation in the context of the DASH project, Splash-2 benchmarks have been widely used in research. However, Splash-2 was released over two decades ago and does not adhere to the recent C memory consistency model. This leads to unexpected and often incorrect behavior when some Splash-2 benchmarks are used in conjunction with contemporary compilers and hardware (simulated or real). Most importantly, we discovered critical performance bugs that may question some of the reported benchmark results. In this work, we analyze the Splash-2 benchmarks and expose data races and related performance bugs. We rectify the problematic benchmarks and evaluate the resulting performance. Our work contributes to the community a new sanitized version of the Splash-2 benchmarks, called the Splash-3 benchmark suite.},

  abstract = {Build verifiability is a safety property for a software system which can be used to check against various security-related issues during the build process. In summary, a verifiable build generates equivalent build artifacts for every build instance, allowing independent auditors to verify that the generated artifacts correspond to their source code. Producing a verifiable build is a very challenging problem, as non-equivalences in the build artifacts can be caused by non-determinsm from the build environment, the build toolchain, or the system implementation. Existing research and practices on build verifiability mainly focus on remediating sources of non-determinism. However, such a process does not work well with large-scale commercial systems (LSCSs) due to their stringent security requirements, complex third party dependencies, and large volumes of code changes. In this paper, we present an experience report on using a unified process and a toolkit to produce verifiable builds for LSCSs. A unified process contrasts with the existing practices in which recommendations to mitigate sources of non-determinism are proposed on a case-by-case basis and are not codified in a comprehensive tool. Our approach supports the following three strategies to systematically mitigate non-equivalences in the build artifacts: remediation, controlling, and interpretation. Case study on three LSCSs within {\textbackslash}sf HuaweiHuawei shows that our approach is able to increase the proportion of verified build artifacts from less than 50 to 100 percent. To cross-validate our approach, we successfully applied our approach to build 2,218 open source packages distributed under {\textbackslash}sf CentOSCentOS 7.8, increasing the proportion of verified build artifacts from 85 to 99 percent with minimal human intervention. We also provide an overview of our mitigation guideline, which describes the recommended strategies to mitigate various non-equivalences. Finally, we present some discussions and open research problems in this area based on our experience and lessons learned in the past few years of applying our approach within the company. This paper will be useful for practitioners and software engineering researchers who are interested in build verifiability.},

In this paper, we introduce DataTracker, a new approach to capturing data provenance based on taint tracking, a technique widely used in the security and reverse engineering fields. Our system is able to identify data provenance relations through dynamic instrumentation of unmodified binaries, without requiring access to, or knowledge of, their source code. Hence, we can track provenance for a variety of well-known applications. Because DataTracker looks inside the executing program, it captures high-fidelity and accurate data provenance.},

Firstly, the lack of data tracking tools built for clouds. Secondly, current logging mechanisms are only designed from a system-centric perspective. There is a need for data-centric logging techniques which can trace data activities (e.g. file creation, edition, duplication, transfers, deletions, etc.) within and across all cloud servers. This will effectively enable full transparency and accountability for data movements in the cloud. In this paper, we introduce S2Logger, a data event logging mechanism which captures, analyses and visualizes data events in the cloud from the data point of view. By linking together atomic data events captured at both file and block level, the resulting sequence of data events depicts the cloud data provenance records throughout the data lifecycle. With this information, we can then detect critical data-related cloud security problems such as malicious actions, data leakages and data policy violations by analysing the data provenance. S2Logger also enables us to address the gaps and inadequacies of existing system-centric security tools.},

  abstract = {Measuring execution time is one of the most used performance evaluation techniques in computer science research. Inaccurate measurements cannot be used for a fair performance comparison between programs. Despite the prevalence of its use, the intrinsic variability in the time measurement makes it hard to obtain repeatable and accurate timing results of a program running on an operating system. We propose a novel execution time measurement protocol (termed EMP) for measuring the execution time of a compute-bound program on Linux, while minimizing that measurement's variability. During the development of execution time measurement protocol, we identified several factors that disturb execution time measurement. We introduce successive refinements to the protocol by addressing each of these factors, in concert, reducing variability by more than an order of magnitude. We also introduce a new visualization technique, what we term `dual-execution scatter plot' that highlights infrequent, long-running daemons, differentiating them from frequent and/or short-running daemons. Our empirical results show that the proposed protocol successfully achieves three major aspects{\textemdash}precision, accuracy, and scalability{\textemdash}in execution time measurement that can work for open-source and proprietary software.

The provenance trace is useful across a wide-range of workflows to improve the dependability, security, and efficiency of software systems. In this paper, we present Inspector, a POSIX-compliant data provenance library for shared-memory multithreaded programs. The Inspector library is completely transparent and easy to use: it can be used as a replacement for the pthreads library by a simple exchange of libraries linked, without even recompiling the application code. To achieve this result, we present a parallel provenance algorithm that records control, data, and schedule dependencies using a Concurrent Provenance Graph (CPG). We implemented our algorithm to operate at the compiled binary code level by leveraging a combination of OS-specific mechanisms, and recently released Intel PT ISA extensions as part of the Broadwell micro-architecture. Our evaluation on a multicore platform using applications from multithreaded benchmarks suites (PARSEC and Phoenix) shows reasonable provenance overheads for a majority of applications. Lastly, we briefly describe three case-studies where the generic interface exported by Inspector is being used to improve the dependability, security, and efficiency of systems. The Inspector library is publicly available for further use in a wide range of other provenance workflows.},

Ideally, artifacts, including tools, benchmarks, and data, support the dissemination of ideas, provide evidence for research claims, and serve as a starting point for future research.

To help the software engineering community realize the full potential of artifacts, we seek to understand the challenges involved in the creation, sharing, and use of artifacts. To that end, we perform a mixed-methods study including a survey of artifacts in software engineering publications, and an online survey of 153 software engineering researchers. By analyzing the perspectives of artifact creators, users, and reviewers, we identify several high-level challenges that affect the quality of artifacts including mismatched expectations between these groups, and a lack of sufficient reward for both creators and reviewers. Using Diffusion of Innovations as an analytical framework, we examine how these challenges relate to one another, and build an understanding of the factors that affect the sharing and success of artifacts. Finally, we make recommendations to improve the quality of artifacts based on our results and existing best practices.},

The Research Object has recently emerged as a comprehensive and systematic method for aggregation and identification of diverse elements of computational experiments. While a necessary method, mere aggregation is not sufficient for the sharing of computational experiments. Other users must be able to easily recompute on these shared research objects. In this paper, we present the sciunit, a reusable research object in which aggregated content is recomputable. We describe a Git-like client that efficiently creates, stores, and repeats sciunits. We show through analysis that sciunits repeat computational experiments with minimal storage and processing overhead.

Research code is typically created by a group of scientists and published together with academic papers to facilitate research transparency and reproducibility. For this study, we define ten questions to address aspects impacting research reproducibility and reuse. First, we retrieve and analyze more than 2000 replication datasets with over 9000 unique R files published from 2010 to 2020. Second, we execute the code in a clean runtime environment to assess its ease of reuse. Common coding errors were identified, and some of them were solved with automatic code cleaning to aid code execution. We find that 74\% of R files failed to complete without error in the initial execution, while 56\% failed when code cleaning was applied, showing that many errors can be prevented with good coding practices. We also analyze the replication datasets from journals' collections and discuss the impact of the journal policy strictness on the code re-execution rate. Finally, based on our results, we propose a set of recommendations for code dissemination aimed at researchers, journals, and repositories.},

We use this information to implement Transparent Result Caching (TREC) and describe how TREC is used to build a number of useful user utilities. Unmake allows users to query TREC for file lineage information, including the full sequence of programs executed to create a particular output file. Transparent Make uses TREC to automatically generate dependency information by observing program execution, freeing end users from the need to explicitly specify dependency information (i.e., Makefiles can be replaced by shell scripts).

Environments are usually described with software and library names associated with version labels or provided as an opaque container image.

We describe this issue and illustrate how open tools like Guix can be used by any scientist to share their environment and allow peers to reproduce it.

  abstract = {With the continuing evolution of sophisticated APT attacks, provenance tracking is becoming an important technique for efficient attack investigation in enterprise networks. Most of existing provenance techniques are operating on system event auditing that discloses dependence relationships by scrutinizing syscall traces. Unfortunately, such auditing-based provenance is not able to track the causality of another important dimension in provenance, the shared libraries. Different from other data-only system entities like files and sockets, dynamic libraries are linked at runtime and may get executed, which poses new challenges in provenance tracking. For example, library provenance cannot be tracked by syscalls and mapping; whether a library function is called and how it is called within an execution context is invisible at syscall level; linking a library does not promise their execution at runtime. Addressing these challenges is critical to tracking sophisticated attacks leveraging libraries. In this paper, to facilitate fine-grained investigation inside the execution of library binaries, we develop Lprov, a novel provenance tracking system which combines library tracing and syscall tracing. Upon a syscall, Lprov identifies the library calls together with the stack which induces it so that the library execution provenance can be accurately revealed. Our evaluation shows that Lprov can precisely identify attack provenance involving libraries, including malicious library attack and library vulnerability exploitation, while syscall-based provenance tools fail to identify. It only incurs 7.0\% (in geometric mean) runtime overhead and consumes 3 times less storage space of a state-of-the-art provenance tool.},

  abstract = {Existing attack investigation solutions for GUI applications suffer from a few limitations such as inaccuracy (because of the dependence explosion problem), requiring instrumentation, and providing very low visibility. Such limitations have hindered their widespread and practical deployment. In this paper, we present UISCOPE, a novel accurate, instrumentationfree, and visible attack investigation system for GUI applications. The core idea of UISCOPE is to perform causality analysis on both UI elements/events which represent users' perspective and low-level system events which provide detailed information of what happens under the hood, and then correlate system events with UI events to provide high accuracy and visibility. Long running processes are partitioned to individual UI transitions, to which low-level system events are attributed, making the results accurate. The produced graphs contain (causally related) UI elements with which users are very familiar, making them easily accessible. We deployed UISCOPE on 7 machines for a week, and also utilized UISCOPE to conduct an investigation of 6 realworld attacks. Our evaluation shows that compared to existing works, UISCOPE introduces neglibible overhead (less than 1\% runtime overhead and 3.05 MB event logs per hour on average) while UISCOPE can precisely identify attack provenance while offering users thorough visibility into the attack context.},

  abstract = {Malicious programs spy on users' behavior and compromise their privacy. Even software from reputable vendors, such as Google Desktop and Sony DRM media player, may perform undesirable actions. Unfortunately, existing techniques for detecting malware and analyzing unknown code samples are insufficient and have significant shortcomings. We observe that malicious information access and processing behavior is the fundamental trait of numerous malware categories breaching users' privacy (including keyloggers, password thieves, network sniffers, stealth backdoors, spyware and rootkits), which separates these malicious applications from benign software. We propose a system, Panorama, to detect and analyze malware by capturing this fundamental trait. In our extensive experiments, Panorama successfully detected all the malware samples and had very few false positives. Furthermore, by using Google Desktop as a case study, we show that our system can accurately capture its information access and processing behavior, and we can confirm that it does send back sensitive information to remote servers in certain settings. We believe that a system such as Panorama will offer indispensable assistance to code analysts and malware researchers by enabling them to quickly comprehend the behavior and innerworkings of an unknown sample.},

  abstract = {In many domains of science, engineering, and commerce, data analysis systems are employed to derive new data (and ultimately, one hopes, knowledge) from datasets describing experimental results or simulated phenomena. To support such analyses, we have developed a ``virtual data system'' that allows users first to define, then to invoke, and finally explore the provenance of procedures (and workflows comprising multiple procedure calls) that perform such data derivations. The underlying execution model is ``functional'' in the sense that procedures read (but do not modify) their input and produce output via deterministic computations. This property makes it straightforward for the virtual data system to record not only the recipe for producing any given data object but also sufficient information about the environment in which the recipe has been executed, all with sufficient fidelity that the steps used to create a data object can be re-executed to reproduce the data object at a later time or a different location. The virtual data system maintains this information in an integrated schema alongside semantic annotations, and thus enables a powerful query capability in which the rich semantic information implied by knowledge of the structure of data derivation procedures can be exploited to provide an information environment that fuses recipe, history, and application-specific semantics. We provide here an overview of this integration, the queries and transformations that it enables, and examples of how these capabilities can serve scientific processes.},

However, some of them are subject to a decay in their ability to be re-executed or reproduce the same results over time, largely due to the volatility of the resources required for workflow executions. This paper provides an analysis of the root causes of workflow decay based on an empirical study of a collection of Taverna workflows from the myExperiment repository. Although our analysis was based on a specific type of workflow, the outcomes and methodology should be applicable to workflows from other systems, at least those whose executions also rely largely on accessing third-party resources. Based on our understanding about decay we recommend a minimal set of auxiliary resources to be preserved together with the workflows as an aggregation object and provide a software tool for end-users to create such aggregations and to assess their completeness},

  abstract = {Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) cannot cope with the increasing number and sophistication of cyberattacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Due to their high false-positive rate and the required effort of security experts to validate them, incidents can remain undetected for up to several months. As a result, enterprises suffer from data loss and severe financial damage. Recent research explored data provenance for Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) as one promising data source to tackle this issue. Data provenance represents information flows between system entities as Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG). Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDS) utilize data provenance to enhance the detection performance of intrusions and reduce false-alarm rates compared to traditional IDS. This survey demonstrates the potential of PIDS by providing a detailed evaluation of recent research in the field, proposing a novel taxonomy for PIDS, discussing current issues, and potential future research directions. This survey aims to help and motivate researchers to get started in the field of PIDS by tackling issues of data collection, graph summarization, intrusion detection, and developing real-world benchmark datasets.},
