1. There is no consensus on what programs to use in order to benchmark provenance systems. See Table 1.
2. Most of the programs people, with the exception of BLAST, are not representative of computational experiment workloads. The publication which presents BEEP (see Table 1 for link) discuss how the loop-structure of long-running processes such as Apache influences the design of provenance systems. Computational experiments do not have long-running processes and are more computational- than I/O-bound when compared to Apache.

Therefore, in order to create a provenance benchmarking system, I would need to standardize around a set of benchmark programs. To ensure representativeness, I want to have a large number of real-world computational science programs.

Footnotes:
1. Section 4, "Open Questions", discusses performance concerns as a topic of future work. However, I could not find future work relating to the performance of OPUS.
2. ext2 and ext3 out-of-date as a representative of native performance; ext4 has consistently better performance (https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Filesystems-Benchmarked)
3. This publication does not say what _workload_ the authors used in connection with this program; e.g., when benchmarking the Apache server, one needs a workload to run agianst it. Some publications merely say they use "batch inputs" or "random inputs", without actually saying how their input is generated.
