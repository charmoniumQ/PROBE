    "Logging into Kaggle for the first time can be daunting. Our competitions often have large cash prizes, public leaderboards, and involve complex data. Nevertheless, we really think all data scientists can rapidly learn from machine learning competitions and meaningfully contribute to our community. To give you a clear understanding of how our platform works and a mental model of the type of learning you could do on Kaggle, we've created a Getting Started tutorial for the Titanic competition. It walks you through the initial steps required to get your first decent submission on the leaderboard. By the end of the tutorial, you'll also have a solid understanding of how to use Kaggle's online coding environment, where you'll have trained your own machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if this is your first time entering a Kaggle competition, regardless of whether you:\n",
    "- have experience with handling large datasets,\n",
    "- haven't done much coding,\n",
    "- are newer to data science, or\n",
    "- are relatively experienced (but are just unfamiliar with Kaggle's platform),\n",

    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is to join the competition!  Open a new window with **[the competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)**, and click on the **\"Join Competition\"** button, if you haven't already.  (_If you see a \"Submit Predictions\" button instead of a \"Join Competition\" button, you have already joined the competition, and don't need to do so again._)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To take a look at the competition data, click on the **<a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Data tab</b></a>** at the top of the competition page.  Then, scroll down to find the list of files.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**train.csv** contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 passengers, to be exact -- where each passenger gets a different row in the table).  To investigate this data, click on the name of the file on the left of the screen.  Once you've done this, you can view all of the data in the window.  \n",

    "- if it's a \"0\", the passenger died.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the first passenger listed in **train.csv** is Mr. Owen Harris Braund.  He was 22 years old when he died on the Titanic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (2) test.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the patterns you find in **train.csv**, you have to predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (in **test.csv**) survived.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Click on **test.csv** (on the left of the screen) to examine its contents.  Note that **test.csv** does not have a **\"Survived\"** column - this information is hidden from you, and how well you do at predicting these hidden values will determine how highly you score in the competition! \n",
    "\n",
    "### (3) gender_submission.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "The **gender_submission.csv** file is provided as an example that shows how you should structure your predictions.  It predicts that all female passengers survived, and all male passengers died.  Your hypotheses regarding survival will probably be different, which will lead to a different submission file.  But, just like this file, your submission should have:\n",
    "- a **\"PassengerId\"** column containing the IDs of each passenger from **test.csv**.\n",
    "- a **\"Survived\"** column (that you will create!) with a \"1\" for the rows where you think the passenger survived, and a \"0\" where you predict that the passenger died."
