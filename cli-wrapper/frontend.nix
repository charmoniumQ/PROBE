    # Prior to this version, the old code had one derivatino per crate (probe-cli, probe-lib, and probe-macros).
    # What could go wrong?
    # Since the old version used `src = ./.`, it would rebuild all three if any one changed.

    # craneLib's workspace example [1] says to use `src = fileSetForCrate ./path/to/crate`.
    # However, when I tried doing that, it would say "failed to load manifest for workspace member lib" because "failed to read macros/Cargo.toml".
    # Because `lib/Cargo.toml` has a dependency on `{path = "../macros"}`,
    # I think the source code of both crates have to be present at build-time of lib.
    # Which means no source filtering is possible.
    # Indeed the exposed packages in craneLib's example (my-cli and my-server) [1] do not depend on each other.
    # They depend on my-common, which is *not* filtered out (*is* included) in the `src` for those crates.
    # If it's possible to simultaneously:
    #   - expose two Cargo crates A and B
    #   - where A depends on B
    #   - when A changes only A needs to be rebuilt
    # then I don't know how to do it.
    # Therefore, I will only offer one crate as a Nix package.
